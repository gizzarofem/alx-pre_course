My second readme
I made a mistake of ommission sorts not naming the commit as per the instructions so I am trying to fix it.
Let's see how this goes
All I am doing now is adding to the README.md file and then commiting with the right name and then pushing
If this doesn't work and the checker is still asking for the right Commit message then I will add a file or directory and push
If that still doesn't work I might have to destroy the sandbox and delete the repo from github and start the project again
Wish me luck
