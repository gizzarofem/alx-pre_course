My first readme
I have created a new branch 
I have made changes commit and pushed to the new branch too 
Now I have to update the Readme file and create a new fie up_to_date at the root of the directory and in it write the git command line used?? 
then commit with the messgae 'How to be up to date in git' and push to the origin, master I guess?
